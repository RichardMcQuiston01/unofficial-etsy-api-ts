### Added

- Project scaffolding: `package.json` (dual ESM/CJS build via `tsup`,
  `exports` map, `engines.node >=18`), `tsconfig.json`, ESLint 10 flat
  config (`typescript-eslint`), Prettier, Vitest with coverage, and a
  `.gitignore`.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow running format/lint/typecheck/test/build on
  Node 18/20/22 for every push and PR against `dev`/`main`.
- `ROADMAP.md`: multi-agent, multi-stage plan for building the package.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Stage 0 interfaces-only contract (client config,
  transport, auth/OAuth2+PKCE, error/rate-limit types, resource module
  conventions) that later stages build against.
